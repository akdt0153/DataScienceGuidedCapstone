    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

    "You could keep going, trying different values of k, training a model, measuring performance on the test set, and then picking the model with the best test set performance. There's a fundamental problem with this approach: _you're tuning the model to the arbitrary test set_! If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

You partition the training set into k folds, train our model on k-1 of those folds, and calculate performance on the fold not used in training.

Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "**A: 1** Preprocessing and Training In this notebook we are starting to build machine learning models using sklearn. We start by looking at the simplest model (mean value) as a predictor or at least a baseline, a starting point. We initially looked at Train/Test Split with a 70/30 split. This process partitions the data into a training and testing set minimizing any bias or overfitting within the model. The training set is used to train the model and the testing is used to test the training. Initially a good place to start is to use the mean as the predictor. We calculate the y_train.mean() and compare to sklearn’s DummyRegressor and uses the fit() and predict(). The values obtained by mean() and the Dummy Regressor agree or closely match, we use metrics to access how good one set of values agree with another. One measure of metrics is R2 (coefficient of determination) which is the measure of the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predicted by our model, the important expressions follow. Mean (y ) ̅=1/( n) ∑_(i=1)^n▒y_i Total sum of squares SStot = ∑_i▒(y_i-y ̅ ) 2 Residual sum of squares SSres = ∑_i▒〖(y_i-y ̂ 〗)2 R2 = 1 - 〖SS〗_res/〖SS〗_tot The baseline model always redicts the mean and should give R2 = 0 whereas a model that perfectly predicts the observed values would have no residual error therefore R2 = 1 and models that do worse than predicting the mean will have increased sum of squares and would produce a negative R2. Using the mean the r_squared(y_train, y_tr_pred) indeed equals to 0. R2 in interpretable in terms of amount of variance explained but less appealing if you want to see how close to you prediction are to the true values. The metrics that summarise the difference between predicted and actual values are. Mean absolute error MAE = 1/n ∑_i^n▒〖|y_i 〗-y ̂| Mean squared error MSE = 1/n ∑_i^n▒〖(y_i 〗-y ̂)2 The mae showed that the estimate might be off by about \r\n",
    "1 and exhibits less variability. We ran the learning_curve function to test whether we need the full training size or just a partial size and we found that the training size was maxed out at about 40 indicating we have sufficient quantity of data."
